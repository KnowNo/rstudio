## TODO

Images should support width/align for gfm (write raw_html)
(we'd need to do the image tag parsing for this to work).
Alternatively, we could send inline html through the schema dom parser to see if it has an internal representation

Sizing/alignment inline for images

Clipboard / DragDrop support for images

Surface attributes

Better direct manipulation for tables

cmd+click for links (or gdocs style popup)


Unit testing for core panmirror code

Make character escaping configurable

Link input rule doesn't work for enter after link
(https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/trigger-inputrule-on-enter/1118/2)

FindUX in standalone
Magic comments in standalone
Dynamic commands/format for standalone front-end

Cursor location for insert yaml in the middle of paragraph

Tables with a large number of columns are written as HTML when variable column widths are presented
(presumably b/c it can't represent the percentage granularity w/ markdown)
Perhaps don't set widths on all of the columns (only ones explicitly sized?)


improve scrolling with: https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll

multimarkdown support is incomplete:
   -mmd_title_block
   -mmd_link_attributes (not written, likely limitation of pandoc)
   -mmd_header_identifiers (work fine, but we currently allow edit of classes + keyvalue for markdown_mmd) 

no support for +pandoc_title_block



We currently can't round-trip reference links (as pandoc doesn't seem to write them, this is
not disimillar from the situation w/ inline footnotes so may be fine)

Improve EditorPane.showPandocWarnings treatment (including localization)

No editing support for fancy list auto-numbering (#. as list item that is auto-numbered)

EditorUI.translate call for translatable text

handling for div with only an id (shading treatment a bit much?)

internal links / external links via cmd+click

Direct parsing of citations (get rid of special post-processing + supported nested)
 (note: for nested we need excludes: '')

## Project/Build

Can we minify the typescript library?

https://fuse-box.org/docs/getting-started/typescript-project

Can we combine the editor library w/ the prosemirror/orderedmap dependencies?

may need to make use of project references (allows mutliple tsconfig.json files
that all reference eachother)
   https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html
will ultimately need something like lerna:

create-react-app currently doesn't support project references:
